# OpenGL Snake-Game

Made by: Caleb Jacobson

Started: 9.21.2024

My first project ever made with the OpenGL api. Following various tutorials and using some previous coding knowledge, this is a simple 'snake' game made purely with the framework and libraries.
This will be my first "game" created without an engine. The goal is to learn more about C++ and about graphics rendering.
